(both Delft University of Technology) and PhD (University of Dundee, 2016) degree in Civil Engineering. With over a decade of experience with field test, laboratory tests and modelling of root-reinforced soil, he aims streamline the integration of nature-based solutions into engineering design by developing innovative measurement techniques (e.g., corkscrew testing) and practical, physics-based models (e.g., DRAM, generic fibre bundle models)."

    "text": "We are writing book! We are working on a book to be published by Elsevier in 2026\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\nHow can the effects of vegetation be incorporated into engineering design and slope stability assessment? This book covers mechanical and hydrological interactions between soil and plant roots. It explores and compares measurement techniques, and systematically dissects predictive models developed in the last fifty years of research. The methodical approach and inclusion of executable code makes it a suitable resource for both researchers and practitioners, especially those new to this field.\nThe contribution of vegetation to slope stability is a complex, multi-scale, and multi-agent mechanism, necessitating inter-disciplinary research. Due to varying backgrounds of researchers working on this topic, standardisation of methods and a systematic classification of models is lacking. This book intends to build confidence among engineers on how to include vegetation in engineering design by providing more clarity on how to quantify reinforcement, by both focussing on how to collect data (measurements) and how to interpret data collected to make predictions for modified soil properties (modelling).\n\n\nStay tuned for further updates"

    "text": "6th International Conference on Soil Bio- and Eco-Engineering (SBEE25) “The Use of Vegetation to Improve Slope Stability” takes place in Xalapa, Mexico between 30th June and 4th July 2025. Details can be seen on conference website.\n\nGerrit is organising a workshop on root reinforcement modelling on the first day of the workshop\nAnil is a member of the scientific committee\nWe are presenting pyrootmemo - our Python package.\n\n\nYou can read our abstract below:\n\npyrootmemo: unifying root reinforcement models\nMeijer, G.J 1 & Yildiz, A. 2\n1 Centre for Climate Change Adaptation & Environment Research, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom\n2 Methods for Model-based Development in Computational Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany\nPredicting the reinforcing effect of plant roots on slope stability has been of academic and professional interest for over half a century. A large number of analytical, empirical, semi-empirical and numerical models have since been proposed. As a physics-based model using well-established constitutive laws or widely used numerical techniques is still largely lacking, many researchers and practitioners continue to employ multiple methods from the literature. However, because these models use a wide variety of soil and root parameters, assumptions, coefficients, systems of measurement units as well as calculation algorithms, it can be challenging to compare results.\nWe present an application, “pyrootmemo”, to simplify the use and comparison of models. Currently incorporated models include well-known models based on force-equilibrium such as those by Wu and Waldron, as well as recent extensions of fibre bundle models and root bundle models. pyrootmemo was developed entirely in Python, utilising the principles of object-oriented programming. Controlled terminology, representing models as objects, and standardisation of data structures enable smooth and error-free model simulations and comparisons. Furthermore, automated metadata extraction yields reproducible model calculations, thus ensuring transparency when making design decisions.\nPyrootmemo is ongoing project that is open-source and free to use. The application is modular, enabling users to adapt and implement elements of pyrootmemo within their own models and code. We highly welcome new contributors and contributions. Our aim is to promote accessibility, interoperability, (re)usability, transparency and standardisation, thus facilitating applications of model-based assessments and design of nature-based solutions against climate-driven geohazards."

    "text": "Gerrit delivered a great workshop titled “Modelling made easy: from basic measurements to slope reinforcement in one day” as part of the SBEE25 6th International Conference on Soil Bio- and Eco-Engineering. Drawing participants from around the globe, the workshop highlighted the potential of the open-source Python package pyrootmemo for calculating root reinforcement using various models. Through guided tutorials and hands-on exercises, attendees learned how to integrate measurement data and run multiple modelling approaches to assess slope stability. By the end of the day, participants left with a deeper understanding of root-soil interactions, as well as practical skills for applying calculations they learned in their own research and projects.\nWorkshop material will soon be available here and on a dedicated repository"
