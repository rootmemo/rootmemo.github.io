    "text": "Dr.¬†Gerrit J. Meijer\n\n\nGerrit Meijer is a lecturer in geotechnical engineering at the University of Bath. He has a BSc., MSc. (both Delft University of Technology) and PhD (University of Dundee, 2016) degree in Civil Engineering. With over a decade of experience with field test, laboratory tests and modelling of root-reinforced soil, he aims streamline the integration of nature-based solutions into engineering design by developing innovative measurement techniques (e.g., corkscrew testing) and practical, physics-based models (e.g., DRAM, generic fibre bundle models)."
