Gerrit delivered a great workshop titled "Modelling made easy: from basic measurements to slope reinforcement in one day" as part of the SBEE25 6th International Conference on Soil Bio- and Eco-Engineering. Drawing participants from around the globe, the workshop highlighted the potential of the open-source Python package [pyrootmemo](https://www.github.com/rootmemo/pyrootmemo) for calculating root reinforcement using various models. Through guided tutorials and hands-on exercises, attendees learned how to integrate measurement data and run multiple modelling approaches to assess slope stability. By the end of the day, participants left with a deeper understanding of root-soil interactions, as well as practical skills for applying calculations they learned in their own research and projects.

Workshop material will soon be available [here](https://rootmemo.github.io) and on a dedicated [repository](https://www.github.com/rootmemo/workshops)
